## PYTHON MACHINE LEARNING TUTORIALs

This project containts several end to end machine learning tutorials. I created these tutorials to help others understand the different phases of a machine learning project. All of the tuturials use the college scorecard data set (https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/):

* classification_tutorial.ipynb: Classification tuturial
* regression_tutorial.ipynb: Regression tutorial

Enjoy!
